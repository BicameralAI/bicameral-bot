# ADR-0003: Local Code Grounding and Cloud Conflict Boundary

**Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Status:** proposed  
**Level:** L1  
**Carries forward:** `bicameral-daemon` ADR-0003 plus the original `bicameral-bot` local grounding ADR

## Problem

The open-core split must not imply that free/public Bicameral is ungrounded. If the local bot only captures notes, it fails the product thesis.

At the same time, full cross-branch, cross-repo, organization-scale code graph and conflict analysis is expensive and belongs in `bicameral-cloud`, not in every local bot install.

## Decision

`bicameral-bot` includes local code grounding for the current repo/worktree. It may inspect files, diffs, paths, symbols, commits, and PR context to produce `BindingEvidence`, `BindingHint`, and local `ComplianceVerdict` proposals.

`bicameral-cloud` owns hosted code graph and conflict advisory infrastructure:

- cross-branch and cross-repo tree-sitter indexes;
- shared code graph caches across workspace members;
- conflict gate / conflict advisory service;
- blast-radius and dependency analysis across repositories;
- expensive or historical grounding optimization.

Cloud returns evidence, hints, advisories, and `GovernanceResult` proposals. It does not become canonical authority; bot governance and the selected event store substrate still decide what materializes.

### Survey-informed rationale

Public developer surveys make local grounding a baseline requirement, not a paid-only enhancement. Stack Overflow's 2024 AI survey reports broad AI use/planned use while also identifying lack of trust in AI output and lack of codebase context as top team-level adoption blockers. DORA 2024 reports that AI can increase individual productivity, flow, and satisfaction while negatively affecting delivery stability and throughput. See [Public Developer Survey Implications](../research/public-developer-survey-implications.md).

Implication: the public/local bot must inspect the current worktree and produce reviewable `BindingEvidence` before Bicameral can claim to reduce cognitive debt. Paid cloud value should concentrate on scale and precision: cross-repo, cross-branch, historical, shared-cache, blast-radius, and expensive conflict intelligence that local inspection cannot provide.

## Local Bot Owns

- current-worktree grounding: files, line ranges, symbols, imports/callers/callees when a local index exists, current diff/branch context, commit metadata, tests, deploy/release files;
- local preflight before an agent edits code;
- local compliance proposals such as `reflected`, `partial`, `drifted`, `pending`, or `ungrounded`;
- routing weak evidence to review instead of silently approving it.

## Cloud Owns

Cloud may build and cache per-branch/per-repo graphs keyed by `(repo_ref, branch_name, pinned_commit)`, including imports, call-sites, type relationships, deploy surfaces, and cross-repo dependencies.

Cloud may produce substrate-neutral `GovernanceResult` records:

- `severity: info | warning | blocking`
- `enforcement_capability: ci_block | dashboard_flag | agent_warning | slack_notification | queued_action | none`
- conflict type: decision conflict, implementation conflict, dependency conflict, compliance conflict.

For git-backed workspaces, review-resolved blocking results can materialize as CI failures if the repository has that enforcement boundary. For non-git substrates, the same result must surface through honest capabilities such as dashboard flags or agent warnings.

## Conflict Advisory Service

Cloud may proactively ask: "If this proposed L2 decision were grounded, what code paths would it likely touch, and what approved decisions might conflict?"

Those predictions are advisory until reviewed.

## HITL Boundary

Local and cloud grounding both preserve the separate confidence surfaces from ADR-0004:

- extraction confidence;
- binding confidence;
- compliance confidence.

High binding confidence does not approve product meaning. High extraction confidence does not make a weak code binding safe to block on. Blocking requires governance policy plus review-resolved evidence.

## Non-Goals

Local grounding does not silently approve compliance or block work. Cloud graph intelligence does not replace local event-store authority.

## Consequences

Free/public Bicameral is useful as a developer tool because it can ground in the current workspace. Paid value concentrates in scale, precision, history, and cross-branch/cross-repo analysis. The same `BindingEvidence`, `ComplianceVerdict`, and `GovernanceResult` vocabulary works for both local and cloud sources.
