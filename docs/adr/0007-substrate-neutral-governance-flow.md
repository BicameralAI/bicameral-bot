# ADR-0007: Substrate-Neutral Governance Flow

> Carries forward `bicameral-daemon` ADR-0007 as the central bot-owned governance path.

**Date:** 2026-05-27
**Status:** proposed
**Level:** L1
**Related:** ADR-0001, ADR-0002, ADR-0003, ADR-0004, ADR-0005, ADR-0006

## Problem

The same governance path was being re-described across the event store, MCP/bot boundary, hosted code graph, HITL, event-store/policy, and UI ADRs. That makes the architecture look more coupled to a specific substrate or UI than it is, and it creates drift risk: each ADR can accidentally define a slightly different route from source evidence to canonical decision state.

Bicameral needs one generic governance flow that works across different integration choices:

- Git-backed workspaces with PR review and CI enforcement.
- Google Drive-backed workspaces with file sync, stale/offline states, and dashboard/agent warnings.
- Dashboard review, Slack modal review, CLI/TUI review, PR review, or batch review.
- owner/member-authored mods that customize extraction/routing without gaining authority over canonical state.
- Connectors for Notion, Slack, Linear, email, documents, MCP sessions, support inboxes, or future sources.

The flow must state which parts are core invariants and which parts are safe extension points.

Public survey evidence supports keeping enforcement capability explicit rather
than assuming every governance result can become a CI check. Stack Overflow's
2024 data shows important decision and coordination work happening in tickets,
docs, chat, meetings, and AI-assisted workflows, while DORA 2024 warns that AI
and platform changes can improve productivity while affecting delivery stability
and throughput. See [Public Developer Survey Implications](../research/public-developer-survey-implications.md).

Implication: `ci_block` is one mapping for git-backed workspaces with a real
merge boundary. Non-git or pre-code decisions need honest mappings such as
`pr_warning`, `dashboard_flag`, `agent_warning`, `slack_notification`,
`queued_action`, `paused_approval`, or no-op.

## Decision

Define a **substrate-neutral governance flow** as the only path from source evidence to canonical decision state. Every connector, mod, review surface, and event store substrate maps into this flow. ADR-0001 defines where accepted events are stored; ADR-0007 defines how a candidate becomes eligible to be stored.

```text
1. Evidence Capture
   source connector, agent session, manual entry, or mod emits SourceEvidence
        ↓
2. Candidate Projection
   extractor/mod creates DecisionCandidate, BindingHint, DependencySignal, or advisory GovernanceResult
        ↓
3. Policy Evaluation
   governance policy validates schema, provenance, source trust, freshness,
   permissions, decision level, evidence strength, collisions, and substrate capability
        ↓
4. Review Command Gating
   a review surface shows only commands allowed by policy/state/capability
   and emits a substrate-neutral ReviewCommand
        ↓
5. Review Event Resolution
   policy converts accepted ReviewCommand into ReviewEvent / GovernanceResult
   while preserving separate extraction, signoff, grounding, and compliance axes
        ↓
6. Materialization
   event store adapter persists accepted domain events in the selected event store substrate
        ↓
7. Enforcement / Notification
   adapter translates GovernanceResult into CI block, PR warning, dashboard flag,
   agent warning, Slack notification, queued action, paused approval, or no-op
```

Canonical decision state changes only after:

1. governance policy accepts the command;
2. the selected event store adapter successfully materializes the accepted domain event; and
3. replay from the selected event store substrate produces the new state.

UI surfaces, Slack actions, CLI commands, PR comments, connectors, and mods are command/evidence producers. They are not canonical authorities.

## Core-Owned Invariants

These parts are not customizable by individual integrations or mods.

### 1. Domain vocabulary

The core domain vocabulary is shared across substrates:

- `SourceEvidence`
- `DecisionCandidate`
- `Decision`
- `ReviewCommand`
- `ReviewEvent`
- `ReviewState`
- `BindingHint`
- `BindingEvidence`
- `DependencySignal`
- `ComplianceVerdict`
- `GovernanceResult`

Connectors and mods may add metadata, but they must map back to these objects before entering policy evaluation.

### 2. Authority separation

- Extraction can propose a `DecisionCandidate`; it cannot approve decision meaning.
- Decision creation is never a manual operation. Frontend, CLI, MCP, connector,
  and mod surfaces can create or edit candidates; a `Decision` can only appear
  in the Decision Ledger through the governed candidate promotion path.
- Owner/member review owns signoff according to workspace governance policy.
- Code graph/grounding owns `BindingEvidence`; source connectors can only provide hints.
- Compliance/drift analysis owns `ComplianceVerdict`; weak or unreviewed verdicts remain advisory.
- Event store adapters own durable materialization.
- No connector, mod, review surface, or MCP tool directly mutates event store internals.

### 3. Independent state axes

The system must not collapse these into one confidence score:

- extraction confidence / candidate quality;
- signoff state;
- grounding/binding confidence;
- compliance/drift state;
- source freshness/provenance;
- substrate enforcement capability.

A strong value on one axis cannot compensate for weakness on another. For example, high extraction confidence does not make a weak code binding safe to block on.

### 4. Replayability

Every canonical state must be rebuildable from the selected event store substrate. SurrealDB, dashboard stores, search indexes, and hosted code graph state are caches/materializations, not authority.

### 5. Allowed-command gating

Review surfaces can only show or emit commands allowed by current governance state, owner/member capability or reviewer assignment, source freshness, evidence strength, and substrate capability.

### 6. Honest enforcement

A `GovernanceResult` must not claim stronger enforcement than the selected substrate can provide. Git can block merges through CI. Google Drive cannot; it can warn, pause, queue, or require review.

### 7. No opaque consequential automation

The system must not perform opaque consequential automation over shared team
state. Consequential transitions such as `approve_signoff`, `resolve_compliance`
to blocking, `supersede_decision`, destructive source removal, or governance
policy changes require explicit accountable review unless workspace policy has
defined a narrow low-risk automation class. That policy decision must itself be
reviewable and replayable.

## Customizable Parts

These parts are intentionally configurable by workspace, source integration, event store substrate, or owner/member-authored mod.

| Flow stage | Customizable | Not customizable |
|---|---|---|
| Evidence Capture | source connector, polling vs webhook, source filters, redaction/pointers | provenance must be recorded; secrets must not be persisted as canonical content |
| Candidate Projection | extraction prompts/rules, labels, feature hints, owner lens, suggested reviewers, domain metadata | outputs remain candidates/hints/signals until policy accepts them |
| Policy Evaluation | source trust, automation mode, required reviewer by level/source, low-risk auto-candidate thresholds | policy cannot skip replayability, authority separation, or substrate capability checks |
| Review Surface | dashboard, Slack, CLI/TUI, PR comment, Drive batch UI, copy/presentation | surfaces emit shared `ReviewCommand`s; they do not invent authority semantics |
| Materialization | git YAML/commits, Drive YAML/event files, future adapter layouts | replayed domain state must match the shared lifecycle |
| Enforcement / Notification | CI block, dashboard flag, agent warning, Slack notification, queued local action, paused approval | enforcement must accurately reflect substrate capabilities |

## Standard Review Commands

Initial command vocabulary:

- `accept_candidate`
- `approve_signoff`
- `reject_signoff`
- `reject_candidate`
- `edit_candidate`
- `request_context`
- `assign_reviewer`
- `bind_to_code`
- `resolve_compliance`
- `supersede_decision`
- `mark_different_scopes`
- `untrack_source`
- `pause_approval`
- `resume_approval`

`accept_candidate` is the v0.1 Promote command: it promotes a valid
`DecisionCandidate` into a Decision Ledger record with `signoff.state =
proposed`. Future protocol revisions may rename this command to
`promote_candidate`, but they must preserve the invariant that all Decision
creation goes through candidate promotion.

Ingestion Gate `Ingest` is a UI-level batch action over an already-projected
candidate set for a source item. It is not candidate creation. It emits one or
more candidate promotion commands for the remaining candidates after the reviewer
has rejected or edited unwanted candidates. Candidate rejection before ingest is
a durable `reject_candidate` transition, not a local UI discard. Replay must
preserve each candidate rejection and promotion as its own lifecycle transition.

A promoted Decision enters `signoff.state = proposed` by default. `proposed` is
the post-ingest dependency/collision-check staging state: the Decision is now in
the Ledger and can be compared against existing Decisions, but it is not approved
until policy and dependency checks resolve. If checks pass and policy permits
automatic approval, the Decision may transition to `approved`. If checks find a
conflict, it transitions to `collision_pending`. If checks are unavailable or
stubbed, it remains `proposed`.

Demotion is a Decision lifecycle operation, not candidate intake. A frontend
Ledger View may directly initiate demotion commands for existing Decisions, such
as `reject_signoff`, `supersede_decision`, or a future `demote_decision` /
`remove_decision` command. Direct frontend initiation does not mean direct
storage mutation: the command must still pass through governance policy,
materialize through the selected event store substrate, and replay into Ledger
state.

Commands are substrate-neutral. `accept_candidate` means the extracted candidate is valid enough to become a Decision Ledger record with `signoff.state = proposed`; it does not approve signoff. `reject_candidate` means the extracted claim is not a valid Decision and records review/audit history without creating a Decision by default. `approve_signoff` means the workspace policy permits the actor/action to move ownership signoff to `approved`. `reject_signoff` means an existing proposed Decision is explicitly rejected and remains inspectable in the Decision Ledger with `signoff.state = rejected`. `resolve_compliance` means grounding, binding, or drift evidence has been reviewed enough to resolve the compliance state. The event store adapter decides whether an accepted command becomes a git commit, Drive file write, queued local event awaiting durable sync, or another substrate-specific artifact. Canonical lifecycle changes must still replay from the selected event store substrate; dashboard-only annotations remain non-canonical.

Adding new commands requires updating this ADR or a successor ADR. Mods may not mint private commands that bypass governance policy. A review surface may submit a batch of domain commands for one UX action, but replay must preserve each command as a separate lifecycle transition in `applied_commands`.

## Standard Governance Result

`GovernanceResult` must include at least:

```ts
type GovernanceResult = {
  severity: 'blocking' | 'warning' | 'info';
  review_state:
    | 'advisory'
    | 'proposed'
    | 'needs_signoff_review'
    | 'needs_grounding_review'
    | 'needs_compliance_review'
    | 'collision_pending'
    | 'stale_source_pending'
    | 'ready_to_materialize'
    | 'materialized';
  evidence_strength: 'weak' | 'reviewed' | 'resolved';
  enforcement_capability:
    | 'ci_block'
    | 'pr_warning'
    | 'dashboard_flag'
    | 'agent_warning'
    | 'slack_notification'
    | 'queued_action'
    | 'paused_approval'
    | 'none';
  source_refs: string[];
  allowed_commands: ReviewCommandKind[];
  applied_commands?: ReviewCommandKind[];
  reason: string;
};
```

## Review State Transitions

Command processing and domain lifecycle are separate. Every accepted command follows the same processing path:

```text
ReviewCommand
  → policy accepts/rejects command
  → accepted domain event is materialized by the selected event store substrate
  → replay updates Decision Ledger / review state / signoff state / compliance state
```

Candidate intake has two outcomes:

```text
SourceEvidence
  → DecisionCandidate
  → reject_candidate
  → rejected candidate review event only; no Decision Ledger record by default

SourceEvidence
  → DecisionCandidate
  → Ingestion Gate Ingest
  → accept_candidate / Promote per remaining candidate
  → Decision Ledger record with signoff.state = proposed
  → dependency/collision check
  → signoff.state = approved | collision_pending | proposed
```

There is no parallel transition from manual UI/CLI input directly to
`Decision`. Manual input enters as `SourceEvidence` and/or a
`DecisionCandidate`, then follows the same promotion path as connector,
integration, MCP, or mod output.

Once a Decision exists, signoff and compliance advance independently:

```text
Decision(signoff.state = proposed)
  → approve_signoff | reject_signoff | supersede_decision | collision_pending | stale_source_pending
  → signoff.state = approved | rejected | superseded | proposed/pending-review

Decision + BindingEvidence/ComplianceEvidence
  → bind_to_code | resolve_compliance | request_context
  → ComplianceVerdict = reflected | partial | drifted | pending | ungrounded
```

A substrate may add intermediate operational states, such as `branch_pending`, `drive_sync_pending`, or `queued_local_write`, but those states must replay back into the shared lifecycle above.

## Integration Examples

### Git-backed workspace

1. GitHub issue, PR comment, MCP session, or manual entry emits `SourceEvidence`.
2. Extractor creates a `DecisionCandidate` with source refs and level hint.
3. Policy checks source trust, branch context, collisions, and reviewer requirements.
4. Review happens through PR review, dashboard, Slack, or CLI; the surface emits `accept_candidate`, `reject_candidate`, `approve_signoff`, `reject_signoff`, `edit_candidate`, `mark_different_scopes`, etc.
5. Git adapter materializes accepted candidates as proposed Decisions in `.bicameral/` YAML changes and/or review commits.
6. Review-resolved blocking results can become CI failures because git has a merge boundary.
7. Replay from git reconstructs canonical decisions and review state.

### Google Drive-backed workspace

1. Meeting transcript, Drive doc, Slack thread, or manual entry emits `SourceEvidence`.
2. Extractor creates a `DecisionCandidate` with source refs and freshness metadata.
3. Policy checks source trust, Drive auth/sync freshness, duplicate candidates, and reviewer requirements.
4. Review happens through dashboard, Slack, CLI/TUI, or Drive-aware batch review; review surfaces emit the same `accept_candidate`, `reject_candidate`, `approve_signoff`, and `reject_signoff` commands.
5. If Drive is stale/offline, policy may allow local draft review but emits `stale_source_pending` / `paused_approval` until shared state is fresh.
6. Drive adapter materializes accepted candidates as proposed Decisions in YAML/event files in the configured Drive folder.
7. Blocking intent becomes dashboard flags, agent warnings, Slack notifications, queued actions, or paused approval; it does not become CI failure.
8. Replay from Drive files reconstructs canonical decisions and review state.

### owner/member-authored mod

1. Mod reads an allowed source and emits candidate metadata, reviewer suggestions, and dependency/risk signals.
2. Policy treats those outputs as hints, not authority.
3. Review surface may display the mod's suggestions and route to the right reviewer.
4. Canonical materialization still requires accepted review commands and event store adapter replay.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Removes repeated governance-flow prose from the other ADRs.
- Lets different integration options share one authority model.
- Makes customization explicit without compromising canonical state.
- Allows git and Google Drive flows to differ in materialization/enforcement while replaying the same domain lifecycle.
- Gives owners/members a safe extension surface: extraction, routing, metadata, presentation, and advisory signals.

Tradeoffs:

- Every connector/mod/review surface must map to the shared command/result vocabulary.
- Event store adapters need clear capability declarations so UI and agents do not over-promise enforcement.
- New review commands require ADR updates instead of ad hoc per-integration behavior.
- Generic lifecycle states may feel more abstract than the concrete git/PR path, but that abstraction prevents Git/CI from becoming the product ontology.

## Rejected Alternatives

- **One governance flow per substrate:** rejected because it would duplicate authority semantics and make cross-substrate behavior unpredictable.
- **Let each review surface define its own commands:** rejected because Slack, dashboard, CLI, and PR review would drift.
- **Let mods customize canonical writes:** rejected because owner/member-safe mods must stay expressive at the edge and deterministic at the core.
- **Treat CI as the universal enforcement model:** rejected because Google Drive and other non-git substrates do not have a merge boundary.
- **Make the Ingestion Gate / Ledger View the flow itself:** rejected because they are the v0 dashboard surfaces from ADR-0006, not the generic governance model. Other review surfaces must enter the same flow.
